# Kickstarter-Challenge
Module 1 Challenge - Kickstarter - 20211103
# Kickstarting with Excel Analysis Report

## Overview of Project
   This Project includes the analysis of subcategory "Plays" according to the launch date and their funding goals.

### Purpose
    The purpose of this project is to to find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The line chart of outcomes with respect to launch date is given below.

	The above chart shows that the most successful events took place in the month of May and June (total 111 and 100 respective successful outcomes). The chances of plays being successful were more in months of May and June.
	However, the most failed campaigns were happened in months of May and October (about 52 and 50 failed outcomes respectively).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The line chart of outcomes with respect to funding goals is given below.

	The percentage of successful and failed outcomes are shown with respect to the funding goal.
	The most failed event percentage was seen in the range of funding goals $45000 to 49999. It was 100% but the total events in that funding range was only one. So, it could either be successful or failed.
	The most successful percentage of events took place in the funding goal range less than $1000. It was almost 76% and number of successful and total projects were 141 and 186 respectively.
	However, despite of the percentage of successful events of funding goals in the range $1000 to $4999 was less (around 73%) than the that of a funding goal less than $1000 (around 76%) the total amount of successful projects were more. The number of successful and total projects were 388 and 534 respectively.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Though the pivot table of launch date vs outcomes was giving the clear idea of more successful months of the year for campaigning, it didn’t give clear idea about the actual years.
	The campaigning end date (in the “Deliverable 1_Launch Date” worksheet) would have given clear idea about how many months were available to make the campaign successful. Also, The percentage of successful and failed campaigns would have been better
	In the “Outcomes Based on Goals” worksheet the pledged amount of respective goals would have given the clearer idea of how exactly the event was successful or failed.

## Results

### Launch Date Conclusions
	The most successful campaigns happened in the months of May and June of the year.
	The most failed campaigns happened in the month of May and July.
	Aggregately month of May was more successful for campaigns (around 67% successful outcome).

### Outcomes Based on Funding Goals Conclusions
	The most successful events happened whose funding goal was less than the amount $1000.
	Second most successful campaigns happened whose funding goal range was between            $ 1000 to $4999(Around 72% successful Outcomes). After comparing number of successful events it can be noticed that the number of successful events of the funding goal range $1000 to $4999 was more (about 388) than number of successful events of the funding goal range less than $1000 (About 141).

### Limitations to Data Set
	According to the pivot table and line charts we could roughly estimate the most successful events with respect to launch date and funding goal. The end date and pledged amounts should have been considered to get the thorough estimation of the outcomes.
	The pivot tables including the end date and pledged amount could have been added to the data set.
